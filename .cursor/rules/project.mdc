# Project Rules (Cursor)

## Scope
Applies to all code in this repository.

## Skills
- Angular (standalone components, RxJS, NgRx if applicable)
- TypeScript (strict typing, generics, utility types)
- NG-Zorro (Ant Design for Angular) components and theming
- Accessibility (ARIA, keyboard navigation, focus management)
- Testing (Jest/Karma, testing-library, mocking services)
- CI/CD (GitHub Actions, pnpm, CodeQL, SonarQube)
- Styling (SCSS, CSS variables, responsive layout)
- API integration (OpenAPI, REST clients)

## Core Rules
- Use Angular best practices with strict TypeScript.
- Prefer standalone components and functional providers.
- Keep components small; move logic to services/helpers.
- Use RxJS operators; always clean up subscriptions.
- Follow NG‑Zorro patterns for forms, tables, modals, notifications.
- Maintain accessibility (labels, ARIA, focus-visible, keyboard support).
- Avoid `any`; prefer typed interfaces and generics.
- Use explicit transitions (avoid `transition: all`).
- Keep styles scoped; avoid `!important` unless overriding third‑party styles.

## Testing
- Add/update unit tests for behavior changes.
- Mock Router/ActivatedRoute/HTTP in tests.
- Cover error paths and edge cases.

## Performance
- Use `OnPush` for heavy components.
- Prefer `async` pipe to manual subscriptions.

## CI Discipline
- Do not bypass linting or TypeScript errors.
- Do not add dependencies without justification.
