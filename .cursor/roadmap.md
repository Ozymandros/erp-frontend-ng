# Roadmap

## Near Term
- Expand unit test coverage for low‑coverage areas.
- Improve accessibility checks in UI components (ARIA, focus states).
- Verify dark/light theme parity across all modules.

## Mid Term
- Add E2E coverage for critical flows (auth, CRUD, exports).
- Reduce API duplication via shared typed clients.
- Improve performance for large tables (virtual scroll, pagination tuning).

## Long Term
- Strengthen design system consistency.
- Automate visual regression testing.
- Tighten CI quality gates (coverage thresholds by package).
