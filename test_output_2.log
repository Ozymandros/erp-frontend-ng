Requests that start with a name are treated as module requests and resolve within module directories (C:/Projects/ERP_ASPIRE_APP/erp-frontend-ng, node_modules).
If changing the source code is not an option there is also a resolve options called 'preferRelative' which tries to resolve these kind of requests in the current directory too.
